    # <str:pk> is a variable name for the unique identifier of the object you are trying to accesses
        and in this case it is the primary key

    # important to note that employees accounts do not have the staff status...the only way to make
        a user account have the staff status is to login to the admin pannel using a superuser account
        and mannually do so or create a super user account which can only be done by the server admin

    #the glamourhaven account is a super user account so just use that.
