# Setting up the Frontend

## Environment Setup

- Linting has been set up for staged commits in the repository.
- We're using `eslint` for js linting, and `prettier` for code formating.
- Please make it a point to install `eslint` and `prettier` plugins on vscode to aid in your coding process.
- Your code has to be properly formatted and have the correct syntax for you to be able to commit your changes.
- Make sure you attend to all warnings and errors before you commit your code

## Getting Started.

- Open `Git Bash` terminal inside root project folder
- cd into the frontend folder by typing

```bash
cd client
```

- Make sure you have nodejs installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

- If the output is not the version of your nodejs installation, install nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- After ensuring you've installed nodejs install [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn).
- To install dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
yarn install
```

## STARTING THE SERVER

- To start the whole application server

```bash
yarn dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
- You're all set. Happy codingüòÅ

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Always run `yarn` after pulling code from the upstream repository.
- Always, **Always** make pull requests to the **dev** branch, not the main branch. All pull requests to the main branch will not be merged.
- Please, always test your code and make sure it works correctly before making a pull request
- Run `yarn format` to format your code before you commit
- Run `yarn lint` to lint all files in the frontend project directory

# Setting up Backend

instructions on how to run the backend server:

- open the project folder (Glamourhaven/backend) in `vs code` or `cmd terminal` on your local machine
- if you are using vscode open the vscode terminal

- run this command to install a virtual environment:

  ```bash
  virtualenv venv
  ```

- Activate the virtual environment from the directory you have installed the `venv`, in our case the current directory
- For Linux:
  ```bash
  . venv/bin/activate
  ```
- For Windows OS:

  ```bash
  . venv/scripts/activate
  ```

- create a `.env` file in the settings folder and add:

  ```bash
    Removed for security reasons

  ```

  then save

- run the following command to install `django` in your virtual environment

  ```bash
  pip install django
  ```

  (might say requirement satisfied)

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  ```

- next run the commands below to migrate models to the database

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- next command will run the server

  ```bash

  ```

- You're all set and ready to codeüòÅ
